Welcome to MatInverse's documentation!
=======================================

MatInverse is a JAX-based GPU-accelerated framework for differentiable multiphysics, with application to inverse design and automatic parameter extraction. Currently, we feature a heat conduction solver, with a mechanical solver in development. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing users to implement their own physics and optimization algorithms.
